                All of the visual effects have been updated in Counter-Strike 2. With Source 2 lighting and particle
                systems, thereâ€™s an all-new look and behavior for water, explosions, fire, smoke, muzzle flashes, bullet
                tracers, impact effects, and more.

                In Counter-Strike 2 the most critical gameplay visuals have been redesigned with readability in mind.
                Bullet impacts can be easily viewed at a distance, and directional blood impacts (that fade over time)
                give you more information as you move through the world.

                Experience completely reauthored explosions, fire, C4 lighting, and more. Leveraging the Source 2 Engine
                and modern hardware, environmental effects in Counter-Strike 2 feature improved visual fidelity and
                greater consistency.

                The UI in Counter-Strike 2 has gotten a complete overhaul, including fresh visual effects throughout the
                HUD. Not only do these improvements look nice, they also communicate important game state.
